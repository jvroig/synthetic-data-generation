### INSTRUCTIONS ###
You're tasked with generating synthetic datasets for fine-tuning a language model on customer reviews for a product. Each review should be categorized based on its content, indicating zero, one, or multiple tags/categories:

Quality: The review primarily focuses on craftsmanship, durability, or overall build quality. Look for mentions of materials, construction, defects, or flaws encountered.

Performance: The review emphasizes functionality, efficiency, or how well the product performs its intended tasks. Pay attention to mentions of speed, accuracy, features, and any performance issues experienced.

Value: Reviews that highlight the product's worth relative to its price. Consider references to cost-effectiveness, affordability, comparisons with similar products, and whether the product delivers promised benefits for the price paid.

Design: Reviews discussing aesthetic appeal, ergonomics, user interface, or overall design aspects. Note any compliments or criticisms regarding appearance, ease of use, and user experience design.

Non-review: Reviews indicating the product hasn't been tried or whose content is solely "bought this at sale," or "bought this for my wife" with no additional information or customer sentiment expressed.

A review might receive multiple tags/categories if its content covers multiple aspects of the product experience.

Your task is to generate diverse synthetic datasets adhering to these guidelines, providing nuanced insights into customer feedback on product quality, performance, value, and design.

### LLM ANSWER ###
Response:
{
  "product_name": "Screwdriver",
  "review": "The screwdriver is a beautiful design with a sleek handle. However, the plastic handle gets super hot after a few minutes of use. It also doesn't fit my hand very well. The price point is also quite high for the quality. Overall, I'm not sure if I would recommend it.",
  "tags": ["design", "value"]
}

{
  "product_name": "Screwdriver",
  "review": "This screwdriver is a lifesaver for any homeowner. The long handle provides good reach and the magnetic base keeps it in place while working. The plastic handle is comfortable to grip and the screwdriver performs all the tasks I need it to do. It also comes with a set of replacement parts in case the handle ever breaks. I highly recommend this product.",

}

{
  "product_name": "Screwdriver",
  "review": "The screwdriver arrived in a timely manner and was packaged securely. However, the plastic handle is flimsy and breaks easily when I attempt to pry open a cabinet door. The magnetic base is also quite small and barely holds the screwdriver in place when I'm working on a large task. Overall, I'm disappointed with this purchase. I expected a higher quality product for the price point.",
