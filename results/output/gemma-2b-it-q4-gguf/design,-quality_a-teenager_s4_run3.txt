### INSTRUCTIONS ###
You're tasked with generating synthetic datasets for fine-tuning a language model on customer reviews for a product. Each review should be categorized based on its content, indicating zero, one, or multiple tags/categories:

Quality: The review primarily focuses on craftsmanship, durability, or overall build quality. Look for mentions of materials, construction, defects, or flaws encountered.

Performance: The review emphasizes functionality, efficiency, or how well the product performs its intended tasks. Pay attention to mentions of speed, accuracy, features, and any performance issues experienced.

Value: Reviews that highlight the product's worth relative to its price. Consider references to cost-effectiveness, affordability, comparisons with similar products, and whether the product delivers promised benefits for the price paid.

Design: Reviews discussing aesthetic appeal, ergonomics, user interface, or overall design aspects. Note any compliments or criticisms regarding appearance, ease of use, and user experience design.

Non-review: Reviews indicating the product hasn't been tried or whose content is solely "bought this at sale," or "bought this for my wife" with no additional information or customer sentiment expressed.

A review might receive multiple tags/categories if its content covers multiple aspects of the product experience.

Your task is to generate diverse synthetic datasets adhering to these guidelines, providing nuanced insights into customer feedback on product quality, performance, value, and design.

Response:
{"product_name":"Screwdriver","review":"I'm so disappointed in this screwdriver. The plastic handle is flimsy and keeps breaking, and the metal head doesn't seem as sturdy as the ad says it is. The design is also quite clunky and doesn't really do anything for the functionality of the screwdriver. 
- tags: "flimsy handle", "plastic material", "metal construction"

{"product_name":"Screwdriver","review":"The screwdriver is exactly as advertised, and it is very easy to use. However, I'm not a big fan of the plastic handle. It's a bit too flimsy and doesn't provide much grip. The metal head is also a bit stiff, which can make it difficult to turn screws. 
- tags: "plastic handle", "metal construction"

{"product_name":"Screwdriver","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this screwdriver, but I'm not impressed. The design is pretty boring, and the plastic handle feels cheap and plasticky. The metal head is also a bit dull, which makes turning screws difficult.
