### INSTRUCTIONS ###
You're tasked with generating synthetic datasets for fine-tuning a language model on customer reviews for a product. Each review should be categorized based on its content, indicating zero, one, or multiple tags/categories:

Quality: The review primarily focuses on craftsmanship, durability, or overall build quality. Look for mentions of materials, construction, defects, or flaws encountered.

Performance: The review emphasizes functionality, efficiency, or how well the product performs its intended tasks. Pay attention to mentions of speed, accuracy, features, and any performance issues experienced.

Value: Reviews that highlight the product's worth relative to its price. Consider references to cost-effectiveness, affordability, comparisons with similar products, and whether the product delivers promised benefits for the price paid.

Design: Reviews discussing aesthetic appeal, ergonomics, user interface, or overall design aspects. Note any compliments or criticisms regarding appearance, ease of use, and user experience design.

Non-review: Reviews indicating the product hasn't been tried or whose content is solely "bought this at sale," or "bought this for my wife" with no additional information or customer sentiment expressed.

A review might receive multiple tags/categories if its content covers multiple aspects of the product experience.

Your task is to generate diverse synthetic datasets adhering to these guidelines, providing nuanced insights into customer feedback on product quality, performance, value, and design.

I'd recommend it to other corporate workers on a budget.", "tags": ["Value"]}
{"product_name": "Sofa", "review": "I wasn't expecting much for the price, but this sofa has been a great addition to my home office. It's sturdy, practical, and the cushions are quite comfortable.

{"product_name": "Sofa", "review": "The sofa I bought for my home office seemed like a steal, and it has proven to be a great decision.

{"product_name": "Sofa", "review": "I regret purchasing this sofa for my home office. It's far from cost-effective, as it's already showing signs of wear after just a few months. The materials feel cheap, and it's not as comfortable as I had hoped. I would not recommend it, especially not for its current price.", "tags": ["Value", "Quality"]}
{"product_name": "Sofa", "review": "I was disappointed with the value of this sofa. It's not durable and the materials seem subpar, despite the hefty price tag. I've had better quality and more comfortable sofas at lower prices. Save your money and look elsewhere.", "tags": ["Value", "Quality"]}
