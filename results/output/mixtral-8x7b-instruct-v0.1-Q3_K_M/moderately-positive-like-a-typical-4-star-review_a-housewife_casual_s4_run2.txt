"review": "The Bright-Carpenter Sofa is a great addition to our living room! It's super comfortable and the color really brightens up the space. I love the classic design with a modern twist. The only downside is that it can be a bit hard to clean the nooks and crannies, but it's worth it for the overall quality and style."
