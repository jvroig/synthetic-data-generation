"review": "Just got the Bright-Carpenter Sofa and I love it! It's so comfortable, my grandkids and I can sit on it for hours. The color is vibrant and bright, just as described. The only thing is, the cushions could be a bit firmer, but that's just me being picky. I highly recommend this sofa to anyone who wants a cozy and stylish addition to their living room."
